# mocha-custom-stack-trace-reporter

This library can be used as a mocha plug-in to report custom stack traces for errors. If the error object that escapes
from a test has a 'stackTrace()' function, then this function is called to retrieve the stack trace and report it. It
also handles unhandled promise rejections and reports them along with the stack trace.
